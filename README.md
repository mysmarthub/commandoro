Description
---

>With this utility, you can automate
the execution of commands on a Linux system.
Create a settings file with the necessary items,
or use/edit the default file.
In each item, collect the necessary commands,
and start their automatic execution when necessary.

>With this utility, it is very convenient 
to perform routine tasks , as well as configure 
and install the system after installation.

>The settings file is very simple and clear, 
and all the commands you need for different 
cases or different systems will be stored in one place.

>In the settings file, a section with a special 
name default is available, 
any commands added to this section 
will be executed by default after the 
main commands are executed.

>You can create your own files with settings
or edit the default settings file. 
If you have created your own settings file, 
just specify the full path to this file when 
running the script as a parameter. 
Keep in mind that at the moment the file 
must be in json format, have this file extension, 
and use the required structure:

>The section with the "default" commands will run anyway.

```json
{
  "Name to be displayed in the list of commands": [
    "command one",
    "command two"
  ],
  "Next name": [
    "command one",
    "command two"
  ],
  "default": [
    "command one",
    "command two"
  ]
}
```

>After starting, the program will prompt you to 
select the desired item, and then execute all the 
commands that are stored in the file with the 
settings under this name/key.
